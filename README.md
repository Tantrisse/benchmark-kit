Note that `all` component benchmarks needs to bo validated to make your component appear on [phpbenchmarks.com](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com).

Code validation
-

You can use [./codeValidation.sh](documentation/codeValidation.md) to validate your code, while you are in development or when you think it's finished.

Code links
-

To show us all features are included, you need to indicate where each feature is coded.

[./codeLink.sh](documentation/codeLink.md) helps you to tell us.

Everything is done
-

When [./codeValidation.sh](documentation/codeValidation.md) and [./codeLink.md](documentation/codeLink.md) say it's good,
you can tell us to launch benchmarks with [contact form](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com/en/contact).

Thank you!
